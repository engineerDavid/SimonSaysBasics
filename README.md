# SimonSaysBasics


This project was done while learning from a Udemy course. It help me refesh on frontend fundamentals and starting to use git. Most of my personal work apart from the Udemy cource is hightlighted in game.js. 

The reason for multiple functions is to allow anyone who wants to modify the simon code to easly find which feeature they want to change.
